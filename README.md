Datasets Chosen: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/philiphyde1/nfl-stats-1999-2022/data 
Why are we choosing this dataset?
- We are choosing this dataset because all four of us are avid football fans. We consistently watch NFL games, keep track of player stats, and play fantasy football. Because of this, we wanted to choose a dataset that reflected our interests and would allow us to come to conclusions about something we care about. A dataset on football statistics can provide us with an opportunity to do so. We are also all fans of different football teams, so it would be fun to compare stats and engage in friendly banter about our teams' statistics!  We want to be able to answer questions like “Do quarterbacks with the most rushing success (defined via rushing yards or touchdowns) tend to translate to the best quarterbacks for fantasy purposes?” or “Do players with the highest number of redzone targets tend to translate to players with the most overall receiving yards?” 
All of this data intrigues us and can be fun to work with.
